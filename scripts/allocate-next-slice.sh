# Allocate the next Ansible slice number — concurrency-safe.
#
# Lives in the SPECS repo (../AnsibleSpecs/scripts/), because the slice
# numbering space it guards lives there too (slices/). /write-slice calls it as
# ../AnsibleSpecs/scripts/allocate-next-slice.sh.
#
# Prints a zero-padded 3-digit slice number (e.g. 043) to stdout and nothing else,
# so callers can capture it directly:
#
#     N=$(scripts/allocate-next-slice.sh)
#
# Why a counter and not "scan slices/ for the max": several /write-slice sessions
# run concurrently against this one working tree. flock serializes them, and the
# reservation is persisted to slices/.next-slice *before* the slice directory
# exists, so a parallel session sees the bump immediately (a dir scan can't — the
# other session's folder isn't created yet).
#
# slices/.next-slice and slices/.slice-alloc.lock are host-local coordination
# (git-ignored, not spec artifacts). .next-slice self-seeds from the highest NNN_
# on disk if missing, and the disk-max floor below self-heals any drift — so
# deleting it is safe. A burned number (allocate, then abandon the slice) leaves a
# harmless gap; that is the accepted cost of collision-safety.
#
# Follow-up work to an existing slice does NOT use this helper — pick a letter
# suffix tied to that slice (e.g. 087b) instead.
